# Networking

### OSI model:

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a reference model\
that standardizes how different networking protocols communicate with each other.

It divides the communication process into seven layers, each with specific functions:

- *Physical Layer*: Deals with physical connections and electrical signals.
- *Data Link Layer*: Manages data frames and error detection.
- *Network Layer*: Handles routing and logical addressing (IP addresses).
- *Transport Layer*: Ensures reliable data transfer (TCP) or fast, unreliable transfer (UDP).
- *Session Layer*: Establishes, maintains, and terminates connections.
- *Presentation Layer*: Translates data formats and provides encryption.
- *Application Layer*: Supports user applications (HTTP, FTP, SMTP, etc.).

### LAN (Local Area Network):

A LAN is a collection of devices (computers, printers, etc.)\
connected within a limited area (building, office, home).

Typical Usage:
- Sharing files, printers, and resources.
- Local communication within an organization.
- Typical Geographical Size: Small (within a building or campus).

### WAN (Wide Area Network):

A WAN connects multiple LANs over a larger geographic area.

Typical Usage:
- Connecting remote offices or branches.
- Accessing the internet.
- Typical Geographical Size: Large (city-wide, country-wide, or global).

### The internet:

The Internet is a global network of interconnected networks.\
It uses the Internet Protocol (IP) for communication.\
Provides services like the World Wide Web, email, and file sharing.

### IP Address:

An IP address is a unique identifier for devices on a network.\
It allows communication between devices using the Internet Protocol.

Two Types of IP Addresses:

- IPv4: Uses a 32-bit address (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

- IPv6: Uses a 128-bit address (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).

### Localhost:

Localhost refers to the loopback address (127.0.0.1).\
It points to the device itself, allowing testing of network services locally.

### Subnet:

A subnet is a portion of a larger network.\
It allows efficient IP address allocation and management.

### Why IPv6 was Created:

IPv6 was created due to the exhaustion of available IPv4 addresses.\
It provides a larger address space and better security features.

### TCP/UDP:

- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):\
Reliable, connection-oriented protocol.\
Ensures data delivery and order.

- UDP (User Datagram Protocol):\
Unreliable, connectionless protocol.\
Faster but doesnâ€™t guarantee delivery or order.

### Port:

A port is a logical endpoint for communication.\
It allows different services to run on the same device.

### Port Numbers:

Memorize these common port numbers:\
SSH: Port 22 (Secure Shell).\
HTTP: Port 80 (Web browsing).\
HTTPS: Port 443 (Secure web browsing).

### Network Connectivity Tool:

Ping is often used to check if a device is connected to a network.
